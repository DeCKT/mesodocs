        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
          Runescape-like MMORPG with elements like skill training, social
          interactions, intriguing combat, equipment collection, fashion
          collection, and completionist activities.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>There will be 4 categories of skills</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Combat</li>
          <li>Collection</li>
          <li>Production</li>
          <li>Support</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Skills Start at level 1, and max out at level 60. Skills will have
          various ways to train, with easier methods providing less progress
          towards levels. Harder, more intensive methods provide quicker ways to
          level up a skill. At the most efficient methods, a skill should take
          about 100 hours to level up all the way.

          <h3>Combat</h3>
          <p>
            Other MMOs will utilize 3 forms of combat, being melee, ranged, and
            magic. Melee will focus on utilizing weapons such as swords. Ranged
            will focus on utilizing ranged weaponry like bows and arrows. Magic
            is unique in that instead of using physical weapons to deal damage,
            damage is done to opponents via magical spells. Many times magic
            will require some sort of resource, being magical runes, mana, or
            energy. This game, while not exactly non-fiction, is less based in
            fantasy, and so the available combat skills for a player to train
            will be melee and ranged.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game Runescape, which this game is highly inspired by, provides
            what is called a combat triangle to help balance the differnt forms
            of combat. A warrior's armor is strong against the piercing
            ammunition from an archer, while especially weak against the
            powerful spells of a mage. Similarly, an archer's lightweight
            leather armor is easily shredded by the sharp tools of a warrior,
            while absorbing and counteracting the damage of a mage's spells. A
            mage's robes are not protective at all, and are easily pierced by an
            archer's arrows, bolts or knives. However, the advantage that a mage
            has is the ability to keep their distance from their warrior target.
          </p>
          <p>
            The balance of this game is inspired by that of Runescape, however,
            with only 2 forms of combat, in order to be competetive a player
            must utilize both forms of combat.
          </p>
          <h4>Melee</h4>
          <p>
            The Melee skill will be primarily utilized in combat against human
            opponents and larger, less agile animals like bears, boars, buffalo,
            or llamas. The Melee skill will be the more difficult of the two
            combat styles to train, as truly gaining experience will require
            dangerous hand-to-hand encounters.
          </p>
          <h5>Weapon Types</h5>
          <ul>
            <li>Knives</li>
            <li>Clubs</li>
            <li>Spears</li>
            <li>Hatchet</li>
            <li>Tomahawk</li>
            <li>Macuahuitl</li>
          </ul>
          <h4>Ranged</h4>
          <p>
            The Ranged skill will be mostly utilized in hunts of wild animals,
            stealthy encounters, or as a way to weaken or otherwise inhibit a
            human opponent before engaging in hand-to-hand combat. The Ranged
            skill will be the safer of the two combat skills to train since it
            can be done at a distance. However, in combat it will be much less
            effective since the skill usually involves throwing or shooting
            something, immediately losing access to that object. While it can be
            dangerous to anger an opponent from a distance, those with more
            advanced Ranged skills will be able to dispatch their target before
            needing to face them head on.
          </p>

          <h3>Collection</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Mining</h4>
          <p>
            While the base idea of Mining being the collection of stones and
            ores remains consistent with many other instances in popular RPGs,
            Mining in this game will not focus much on delving into caves and
            finding rich ore veins using strong pickaxes. As this game is more
            loosely based on the advances of the Meso-American people, ores and
            metals will not be very well refined or easily acquired. Metals used
            will primarily be copper and gold, with more endgame progress giving
            the player access to small amounts of iron.
          </p>
          <p>
            One of the main uses of mining will be acquiring stone. Depending on
            the area the player finds themself in, they will be able to find
            smaller stones to use for rudimentary tools like knives. Larger
            amounts of stone can be collected with tools, allowing for advances
            in things like fireplaces with cooking, or furnaces for smelting
            alloys.

          <h3>Support</h3>
          <p></p>
          <h4>Trade</h4>
          <p>
            The Trade skill will enable players to exchange goods and equipment
            with other players and with NPCs. Higher levels of trade will enable
            players to get better deals, to have better estimates on item
            values, and more easily develop relationships with NPCs from cities,
            towns and villages other than their own. The Trade skill can be
            tightly interwoven with just about any other skill, buying and
            selling animal pelts, refined materials, armor and weapons, and so
            on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Inspired by the player-driven economy of the MMO Albion Online,
            certain resources will be less available in different areas, and so
            a potential way to gain wealth is to acquire resources, tools, or
            equipment in an area where those items are plentiful and more
            accessible and to transport those items and trade them.
          </p>
          <h4>Husbandry</h4>
          <p>
            Husbandry is the process of raising and caring for animals. Training
            this skill will begin with either capturing a wild animal through
            the Hunting skill, or purchasing wild or already domesticated
            animals through the Trade skill. Animals will then be cared for
            through the creation of habitats, feeding, training, and breeding.
          </p>
          <p>
            There will be several tiers of animals which can be managed. Lower
            tier animals will be easier to deal with, but will provide less
            benefits to the player. Higher tiers will be more difficult but much
            more rewarding. Not all animals will serve the same purpose. There
            will be some animals which only really are used for their products,
            such as meats, pelts, feathers, eggs, or other animal products.
            Other animals will serve as beasts of burden or as combat and
            hunting companions.
