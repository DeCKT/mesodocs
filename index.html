        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>There will be 4 categories of skills</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Combat</li>
          <li>Collection</li>
          <li>Production</li>
          <li>Support</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Skills Start at level 1, and max out at level 60. Skills will have
          various ways to train, with easier methods providing less progress
          towards levels. Harder, more intensive methods provide quicker ways to
          level up a skill. At the most efficient methods, a skill should take
          about 100 hours to level up all the way.

          <h3>Combat</h3>
          <p>
            Many other MMOs will utilize 3 forms of combat, being melee, ranged,
            and magic. Melee will focus on utilizing weapons such as swords.
            Ranged will focus on utilizing ranged weaponry like bows and arrows.
            Magic is unique in that instead of using physical weapons to deal
            damage, damage is done to opponents via magical spells. Many times
            magic will require some sort of resource, being magical runes, mana,
            or energy. This game, while not exactly non-fiction, is less based
            in fantasy, and so the available combat skills for a player to train
            will be melee and ranged.
          </p>
          <p>
            The game Runescape, which this game is highly inspired by, provides
            what is called a combat triangle to help balance the differnt forms
            of combat. A warrior's armor is strong against the piercing
            ammunition from an archer, while especially weak against the
            powerful spells of a mage. Similarly, an archer's lightweight
            leather armor is easily shredded by the sharp tools of a warrior,
            while absorbing and counteracting the damage of a mage's spells. A
            mage's robes are not protective at all, and are easily pierced by an
            archer's arrows, bolts or knives. However, the advantage that a mage
            has is the ability to keep their distance from their warrior target.
          </p>
          <p>
            The balance of this game is inspired by that of Runescape, however,
            with only 2 forms of combat, in order to be competetive a player
            must utilize both forms of combat.
